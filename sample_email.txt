Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Damaged Goods â€“ Order #88291

Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to lodge a complaint about a recent delivery (Order #88291) that arrived with two items visibly damaged. The packaging was intact, so this may have occurred prior to shipping.

Please initiate a return or replacement process at the earliest.

Regards,  
Rahul Mehta
